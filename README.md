
# Football Matches DBMS

We wanted to create a database system that stores relevant information about football that can be used by football fans and enthusiasts, as well as football organizations.
This relevant information includes data about the teams, players, managers, trophies, leagues,â€¦






## Tech Stack


**DBMS:** MySQL & MySQL Data Modeler

**WebApp:** Python



## Sample Queries

- List all players in a team.
- List the teams with more than 5 trophies.
- List the matches that were watched by more than 50 thousand fans live.
- List the stadiums located in a certain country or city.
## Demo

We designed a simple webapp, linked it to the database, tried some functions in a user friendly manner.

Functions that we tried included inserting new records, updating records, or deleting records.

When you open the link in your browser, the homepage will appear directly in front of you. It first suggests to "Add New Team" by filling several fields, including: 

- Team Name
- Established Date
- Type
- Owner ID
- Manager ID

This is a list of already added teams into the databse as an example:

\
\
\
Now for demonstration, if we wanted to add a new team called "Real Madrid" for example, the following fields should be added as shown. We then click "Add Team" and the database will result the following:


<img src="https://github.com/RazanDoughman/FootballApp/blob/main/public/pic3.png" alt="screenshot" width="400" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/RazanDoughman/FootballApp/blob/main/public/pic4.png" alt="screenshot" width="400" />

\
\
\
\
We can also edit a field in a team by choosing "Edit" next to the wanted team in the Team List space. The "Edit" option will let you modify any category for that team, and then choosing the "Update Team" will result in an updated version in the database. This is presented down below as:

\
\
Moreover, we have the choice to delete a whole team from our "Team List" by choosing the "Delete" option next to the wanted team and agreeing to the pop notification that will appear. The whole team with its information will be deleted completely from our database as follows:
